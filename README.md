## Course description:
Data Structures and Algorithms:is course introducesstudents to design strategies for data structures
and algorithms, theoretical limits to space and time requirements, time/space trade ofs, and open
problems in the field.

## Course objective(s) and learning outcomes:
- Understand  the concepts, theory and fundamentals of data structures and algorithms
- Master the core data structures including arrays, linkedlists, hashtables, stacksandqueues, and trees and graphs
- Acquire and apply the knowledge of algorithms complexity and running time analysis and memory footprint
- Practice key programming techniques such as recursion and dynamic programming
- Compare and contrast the basic sorting and searching algorithms
- Establish a bridge towards the practical and hands-on experience with application and system programming
